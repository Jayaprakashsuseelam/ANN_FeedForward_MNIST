# ANN_FeedForward_MNIST
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that implements a Feedforward Neural Network (ANN) for classifying handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. The model is built using TensorFlow/Keras and trained to recognize digits (0-9) with high accuracy.

# 🚀 Features
✅ Loads and preprocesses the MNIST dataset (28×28 grayscale images).
✅ Uses a fully connected neural network (ANN) for digit classification.
✅ Implements ReLU activation for hidden layers and Softmax activation for output.
✅ Optimized with Adam optimizer and trained using Sparse Categorical Crossentropy loss.
✅ Includes training, evaluation, and performance metrics.
