# ANN FeedForward MNIST
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that implements a Feedforward Neural Network (ANN) for classifying handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. 
The model is built using TensorFlow/Keras and trained to recognize digits (0-9) with high accuracy.

## 🚀 Features
- ✅ Loads and preprocesses the MNIST dataset (28×28 grayscale images).
- ✅ Uses a fully connected neural network (ANN) for digit classification.
- ✅ Implements ReLU activation for hidden layers and Softmax activation for output.
- ✅ Optimized with Adam optimizer and trained using Sparse Categorical Crossentropy loss.
- ✅ Includes training, evaluation, and performance metrics.
